✨ Serrated Bloom in Monochrome ✨

A 3D generative art piece exploring the intersection of organic motion and geometric precision. Twelve concentric serrated rings oscillate in space, accompanied by 30 animated spikes and floating particles—all rendered in pure black and white.

Created with p5.js using WEBGL, this piece features:
🔸 Complex multi-layered serrated geometry
🔸 Dynamic camera movement for cinematic depth
🔸 Three-axis oscillating motion (no full rotations—only graceful 180° sways)
🔸 100 particle system creating atmospheric depth
🔸 Triple nested core structures

The artwork never fully spins—instead, it gently rocks and tilts like a delicate flower in the wind, revealing new angles and patterns with each subtle movement.
